# A multiplayer game with Unity

### Why?

Wrote many UI and other 'local' projects, it's time to play with the server side.

### Features / Networks
 - One player host the game (as server), then others join him
 - Delay handling strategy, for a smooth experience and fairness (eg who's bullets hit first?)
 - Turn on delay in NetworkManager to feel the delay (or the lack of it)
   
### Features / Others
 - Add physics for Unity's pathfinding system (which is very ANTI physics, probably for good reason? but not very fun)
 - Toss ninja-star, bullet, or blackhole if you wish
 - Special effects made with HDR (High dynamic color range / rendering pipe)

And be careful. Boss has a giga lazer


### To Run

Open in Unity and run "network test" scene

OR

Run .exe .apk in /build folder (might not be the newest one)
